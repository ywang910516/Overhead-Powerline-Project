# Overhead-Powerline-Project
This repository contains the data and scripts related to the study of "The impact of electrical hazards from overhead power lines on urban search and rescue operations during extreme flood events"

The study was published in the International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction" in Volume 104 in April 2024.

## A brief introduction of this study:
Accurate flood forecasting and efficient emergency response operations are vital, especially in the case of urban flash floods. The dense distribution of power lines in urban areas significantly impacts search and rescue operations during extreme flood events. However, no existing emergency response frameworks have incorporated the impacts of overhead power lines on lifeboat rescue operations. This study aims to determine the necessity and feasibility of incorporating overhead power line information into an emergency response framework using Manville, New Jersey, during Hurricane Ida as a test bed. We propose an integrated framework, which includes a building-scale flood model, urban point cloud data, a human vulnerability model, and network analysis, to simulate rescue operation feasibility during Hurricane Ida. Results reveal that during the most severe point of the flood event, 46% of impacted buildings became nonrescuable due to complete isolation from the road network, and a significant 67.7% of the municipalityâ€™s areas that became dangerous for pedestrians also became inaccessible to rescue boats due to overhead power line obstruction. Additionally, we identify a continuous 10-hour period during which an average of 43.4% of the 991 impacted buildings faced complete isolation. For these structures, early evacuation emerges as the sole means to prevent isolation. This research highlights the pressing need to consider overhead power lines in emergency response planning to ensure more effective and targeted flood resilience measures for urban areas facing increasingly frequent extreme precipitation events.

## Repository Structure
**Data/**: Contains datasets used for analysis.
**scripts/**: Contains scripts for data processing and analysis.
**plot/**: Contains plots of this study

## Reproduce the analysis
ArcGIS Pro and Python are required.
1. Prepare the necessary software and download the required data from #Data.
2. Using the introduction file (scripts/Processing_ArcGIS-Pro.txt), pre-process the data in ArcGIS Pro.
3. Follow the instructions in the Network Analysis Module (found in the command lines of scripts/makeEvaRoutes.py) to perform network analysis in ArcGIS Pro.
4. Run the script FindNotRescuable.py (scripts/FindNotRescuable.py) to identify all non-rescuable houses at each time step.
5. Run the script FindEvacuable.py (scripts/FindEvacuable.py) to identify all non-evacuable houses at each time step.
6. Run the script Compare_cross.py (scripts/Compare_cross.py) to identify houses that are "rescuable but non-evacuable" and "evacuable but non-rescuable."
